## DjangoBlog

this is my first Django project, it has a lot of shit code, but at the same time all the intended functions work

# What is implemented in the project:

1 - news feed  
2 - the ability to add news  
3 - news-headline + text + picture + video link  
4 - you can add comments to the news (only for authorized users)  
5 - the ability to register by mail (by clicking on the link in the mail to activate your account)
6 - the ability to edit publications  
7 - pagination
